/**
 * Recalculate all shop balances - ONE TIME SETUP FUNCTION
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES:
 * - Goes through ALL shops in your database
 * - Calculates the correct balance for each shop based on their completed orders
 * - Updates the balance column in the shops table
 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * - Run this ONCE when you first set up the balance system
 * - Run this if you ever need to "reset" all balances to be correct
 * - Run this if you think balances got messed up somehow
 *
 * CAN YOU DELETE IT LATER?
 * - YES! After running it once, you can delete this function
 * - The main updateShopBalance function will handle future updates automatically
 * - The database trigger will also handle updates automatically
 *
 * HOW TO USE:
 * 1. Run the SQL functions in Supabase first
 * 2. Call this function once: await recalculateAllShopBalances()
 * 3. Delete this function if you want (it's just for initial setup)
